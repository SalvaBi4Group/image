# Ideas for extending draw.io

draw.io is intended to be a base diagramming framework to build more diagramming applications for specific domains. We receive requests for certain large features more frequently. Rather than create a single bloated application, we encourage developers to create extended versions of draw.io that address these use cases.

This page is a store of the most popular use cases requested:

* BPMN 2.0 format output
* Mind mapping
* Org Charts
* Networks
* Floorplans
